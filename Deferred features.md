# Ichiban App — Deferred Features

This file tracks features and behaviours that have been **designed and partially scaffolded
but not yet fully built**. Each entry includes enough context to implement it cold, without
needing to refer back to the original handover conversation.

**Rules — read before every session:**
- When a new handover document is uploaded: read this file FIRST. If any item can be built as part of that handover, build it, then **DELETE it from this file**.
- When any item is built for any reason: **DELETE it from this file immediately** after completion.
- When a new deferred item is identified during implementation: **ADD it here immediately**.
- This file must only ever contain things not yet built. Nothing completed stays here.

## 1. GDPR — Automatic Anonymisation (Cloud Function)

**Source:** Disciplines, Ranks & GDPR handover — Section 5.3
**Depends on:** Memberships feature (lapse date must be stored on membership record)
**Scope:** Backend / Firebase Cloud Functions — NOT Flutter

**What it is:**
A scheduled Cloud Function that runs daily and anonymises any lapsed member whose
personal data retention period has expired.

**Logic:**
- Find all profiles where `isActive = false` AND `isAnonymised = false`
- For each, find their most recent membership record and check the lapse date
- If `lapse date + gdprRetentionMonths` (from appSettings, default 12) ≤ today,
  trigger the same anonymisation process as the manual trigger above
- `gdprRetentionMonths` is stored in `appSettings/gdprRetentionMonths` ✅

**Note:** The Flutter app only needs to display the anonymised state correctly
(the `isAnonymised` field already exists on `Profile`). The Cloud Function
is entirely backend work.

## 3. GDPR — Data Export (Right of Access)

**Source:** Disciplines, Ranks & GDPR handover — Section 5.5
**Depends on:** Memberships, Enrollment, Grading, Attendance, Payments features
(all need to be built before a complete export is possible)
**Can be partially built now:** Profile-only export could be done immediately.

**What it is:**
Admin can export a full member record on request. The export includes:
- All profile fields
- All membership records
- All enrolment records
- All grading records
- All attendance records
- All payment records

**Format:** Admin chooses at export time: PDF, CSV, or both.

**Where to build it:**
- Add an 'Export Member Data' action on `ProfileDetailScreen`
- A bottom sheet or dialog lets admin choose PDF / CSV / Both
- Fetch all related records for the profile across all collections
- Generate the chosen format(s) and share/download
- Consider using `pdf` and `csv` packages (not yet in pubspec.yaml — add them)
- No sensitive data should be logged during export

## 4. Discipline Inactivity Enforcement (Grading only)

**Source:** Disciplines, Ranks & GDPR handover — Section 3
**Depends on:** Grading feature

**What is already built:**
- `isActive` flag on `Discipline` entity ✅
- `activeDisciplineListProvider` streams only active disciplines ✅
- The deactivation toggle + warning banner in `DisciplineFormScreen` ✅
- **Enrollment guard:** `EnrolStudentUseCase` throws if `discipline.isActive == false` ✅
- **Enrollment UI:** `EnrolDisciplineScreen` only shows active disciplines ✅
- **Attendance UI:** `CreateAttendanceSessionScreen` and `SelfCheckInScreen` filter to active disciplines via `activeDisciplineListProvider` ✅

**What still needs enforcing:**
- Grading: when triggering a grading event, only allow active disciplines (same pattern)

**Update (Grading feature built):** `CreateGradingEventScreen` already uses `activeDisciplineListProvider` for the discipline dropdown, so inactive disciplines are excluded from new event creation ✅. The remaining gap is that `CreateGradingEventUseCase` does not yet throw if a caller bypasses the UI with an inactive `disciplineId`. This is the outstanding enforcement gap.

Admin can still **view** inactive disciplines and their enrolled students for
historical reference — already supported via `disciplineListProvider`.

---

## 5. Minimum Attendance for Grading Enforcement

**Source:** Disciplines, Ranks & GDPR handover — Section 3
**Depends on:** Grading feature, Attendance feature

**What it is:**
Each rank has an optional `minAttendanceForGrading` integer field (already in the
`Rank` entity and stored in Firestore). Before a student can be put forward for
grading to a specific rank, their session attendance count for that discipline
must be ≥ `minAttendanceForGrading`.

**What is already built:**
- `minAttendanceForGrading` field on `Rank` entity ✅
- Field is editable in `RankFormScreen` ✅
- Stored in Firestore ✅

**What still needs building:**
In the Grading feature, when an admin selects a student and a target rank:
- Fetch the student's attendance count for the relevant discipline
- Compare against `rank.minAttendanceForGrading`
- If the student hasn't met the threshold, show a warning (not a hard block —
  admin can override with confirmation)

## 8. Dashboard Screen

**Source:** App scaffold
**Depends on:** Multiple features (needs data from profiles, attendance, memberships)

**What it is:**
The admin dashboard (`/admin/dashboard`) is currently a `_PlaceholderScreen`.
No handover document has been received for this feature yet.

---

## 9. Student App Screens (Attendance History)

**Source:** App scaffold
**Depends on:** Nothing blocking

**What they are:**
The following student route is currently a `_PlaceholderScreen`:
- `/student/attendance` — student's own attendance history

`/student/home` (StudentHomeScreen), `/student/checkin` (SelfCheckInScreen), and `/student/grades`
(StudentGradesScreen) are all fully built ✅.
No handover document has been received for the attendance history screen yet.

---

## 10. Admin Screens — Settings, Notifications

**Source:** App scaffold
**Depends on:** Respective handover documents (not yet received)

**What they are:**
The following admin routes are currently `_PlaceholderScreen`:
- `/admin/settings`
- `/admin/notifications`

Each will be implemented when its handover document is provided.

**Note:** `/admin/enrollment`, `/admin/attendance`, `/admin/grading`,
`/admin/memberships`, and `/admin/payments` are all fully built ✅.

---

## 12. Memberships — Lapsed Membership Flag on Dashboard

**Source:** Attendance handover
**Depends on:** Memberships feature, Dashboard feature

**What it is:**
When a student's membership is lapsed or expired and they check in (via self check-in),
an admin flag should appear on the dashboard to prompt follow-up.

**Where stubs live:**
- `lib/domain/use_cases/attendance/self_check_in_use_case.dart` — `// TODO(memberships):` comment

**Logic to implement:**
1. On self check-in, check if the student's membership for the discipline is lapsed/expired
2. If yes, write a `membershipFlags` document: `{studentId, disciplineId, sessionId, date, type: 'lapsed'}`
3. The admin dashboard should surface these flags for admin action

---

## 14. Grading — Push Notifications

**Source:** Grading feature implementation
**Depends on:** Notifications / Firebase Cloud Messaging feature

**What it is:**
Two points in the grading flow currently write `NotificationLog` documents to Firestore
but do not send actual push notifications. When the notifications infrastructure is in place,
these stubs need to be wired up.

**Where the stubs live:**

1. **Nomination** — `lib/domain/use_cases/grading/nominate_student_use_case.dart`
```dart
// TODO(notifications): send push notification to student
// Type: gradingEligibility
// Recipient: studentId
// Payload: { gradingEventId, disciplineId, eventDate }
// The NotificationLog document is already written above.
```

2. **Promotion** — `lib/domain/use_cases/grading/record_grading_results_use_case.dart`
```dart
// TODO(notifications): send push notification to student
// Type: gradingPromotion
// Recipient: studentId
// Payload: { disciplineId, rankAchievedId, gradingScore, gradingDate }
// The NotificationLog document is already written above.
```

**Logic to implement:**
- Integrate with FCM (or equivalent) to send a push to the student's registered device token
- Device tokens should come from a `deviceTokens` subcollection on the profile (to be designed)
- The `NotificationLog` documents already record `sentAt` — update this after a successful send

## 15. Memberships — Automatic Lapse & Trial Expiry (Cloud Functions)

**Source:** Memberships handover
**Depends on:** Memberships feature ✅ (now built)
**Scope:** Backend / Firebase Cloud Functions — NOT Flutter

**What it is:**
Two scheduled Cloud Functions that run daily to keep membership statuses current without
requiring admin action:

1. **Lapse function** — finds all `active` memberships where `subscriptionRenewalDate < today`
   and updates their `status` to `lapsed`, sets `isActive = false`, and writes a `membershipHistory`
   record with `changeType: lapsed`.

2. **Trial expiry function** — finds all `trial` memberships where `trialExpiryDate < today`
   and updates their `status` to `expired`, sets `isActive = false`, and writes a `membershipHistory`
   record with `changeType: cancelled` (or a new `expired` change type if added).

**Firestore fields available:**
- `subscriptionRenewalDate` (Timestamp) on all non-trial, non-PAYT memberships
- `trialExpiryDate` (Timestamp) on trial memberships
- `status` (String — enum name)
- `isActive` (bool)
- `membershipHistory` subcollection (via `FirestoreMembershipHistoryRepository`)

**Note:** The Flutter app reads `status` and `isActive` as set by these functions. No Flutter
change is needed — lapsed/expired memberships will automatically surface correctly in all
existing screens once the functions run.

---

## 16. Memberships — Stripe Payment Integration

**Source:** Memberships handover
**Depends on:** Memberships feature ✅ (now built), Stripe account setup
**Scope:** Backend Cloud Functions + Flutter (partial)

**What it is:**
The `Membership` entity has `stripeCustomerId` and `stripeSubscriptionId` placeholder fields
already stored on the Firestore document. When Stripe integration is built:

1. **Backend:** Cloud Functions handle Stripe webhooks (`invoice.paid`, `invoice.payment_failed`,
   `customer.subscription.deleted`) and update Firestore membership status accordingly.

2. **Flutter:** `PaymentMethod.stripe` is already a valid enum value. The Create wizard's
   payment step should show a Stripe option that launches the Stripe payment sheet (using
   `flutter_stripe` package — not yet in `pubspec.yaml`).

3. **Renewal:** Stripe subscriptions auto-renew; the Cloud Function webhook updates
   `subscriptionRenewalDate` and writes a `membershipHistory` record after each successful charge.

**Note:** `CashPayment` records are NOT written for Stripe payments — the Stripe webhook
handles the payment record side. The `paymentMethod: stripe` guard in `CreateMembershipUseCase`
already skips the cash payment write.

---

## 17. Memberships — Dashboard Lapsed / Expiring Flags

**Source:** Memberships handover
**Depends on:** Memberships feature ✅ (now built), Dashboard feature (item 8, not yet built)

**What it is:**
The admin dashboard should surface memberships needing attention:

1. **Lapsed memberships** — count of memberships with `status: lapsed`; tapping navigates
   to `/admin/memberships` pre-filtered to `lapsed` status.

2. **Expiring soon** — count of `active` memberships where `subscriptionRenewalDate` is within
   the next N days (N from `appSettings/lapseReminderPreDueDays`); tapping navigates to the
   memberships list with an "expiring soon" filter.

3. **Trial expiring soon** — count of `trial` memberships where `trialExpiryDate` is within
   the next N days (N from `appSettings/trialExpiryReminderDays`).

**Providers already available:**
- `membershipsByStatusProvider(MembershipStatus.lapsed)` — use this for lapsed count
- `membershipListProvider` — filter client-side by `subscriptionRenewalDate` proximity
- `appSettingsProvider` — already exists; read `lapseReminderPreDueDays` and
  `trialExpiryReminderDays` keys
