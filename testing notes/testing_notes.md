# Ichiban App — Testing Notes

Each section covers a feature or phase. Items marked ✅ are straightforward
happy-path checks. Items marked ⚠️ flag edge cases, known gaps, or things that
depend on a later phase being in place before they can be fully verified.

---

## Phase 0 — Project Scaffold

- [ ] ✅ App builds (flutter run) in both admin and student flavors without errors
- [ ] ✅ Firebase connects successfully (no Firestore permission errors on launch)
- [ ] ✅ Admin flavor opens to `/admin/login`
- [ ] ✅ Student flavor opens to `/student/select`

---

## Phase 1 — Data Layer (Entities, Repos, Converters, Seeder)

### Database Seeder

Run the seeder once against a fresh Firestore project and verify:

- [ ] ✅ `membershipPricing` collection contains 8 documents
- [ ] ✅ `appSettings` collection contains 8 keys:
      `lapseReminderPreDueDays`, `lapseReminderPostDueDays`,
      `trialExpiryReminderDays`, `dojoName`, `dojoEmail`,
      `privacyPolicyVersion`, `gdprRetentionMonths`, `financialRetentionYears`
- [ ] ✅ `emailTemplates` collection contains 4 documents
- [ ] ✅ `disciplines` collection contains 5 documents:
      Karate, Judo, Jujitsu, Aikido, Kendo
- [ ] ✅ Each discipline has a `ranks` subcollection
- [ ] ✅ Karate has 14 ranks (9 kyu + 5 dan)
- [ ] ✅ Judo has 29 ranks (18 mon + 6 kyu + 5 dan)
- [ ] ✅ Jujitsu has 19 ranks (14 kyu incl. tab variants + 5 dan)
- [ ] ✅ Aikido has 12 ranks (1 ungraded + 6 kyu + 5 dan)
- [ ] ✅ Kendo has 11 ranks (6 kyu + 5 dan)
- [ ] ✅ All Judo mon ranks have `monCount` set (0, 1, or 2)
- [ ] ✅ Jujitsu 7th Kyu and 6th Kyu variants have `monCount` 0–3
- [ ] ✅ Jujitsu 8th Kyu (white) has `monCount: null`
- [ ] ✅ Aikido ungraded rank has `rankType: "ungraded"` and colourHex `#FF0000`
- [ ] ✅ Kendo ranks have colourHex set (#FFFFFF kyu, #000000 dan)
- [ ] ⚠️ Seeder is idempotent — running it twice does NOT create duplicate documents
      (each collection checks `snap.docs.isNotEmpty` and skips if already seeded)

### Converters

- [ ] ✅ Round-trip test: create a `Profile` in Firestore via `ProfileConverter.toMap`,
      read it back via `ProfileConverter.fromMap` — all fields match including
      GDPR fields and nullable fields
- [ ] ✅ Same round-trip for `Discipline` and `Rank` (including `rankType` enum
      serialised as string name, `monCount` null vs int)
- [ ] ⚠️ `Timestamp` fields — verify `registrationDate`, `createdAt`, `dataProcessingConsentDate`,
      `anonymisedAt` survive the Firestore round-trip without timezone drift

---

## Phase 2 — Auth

### Admin login

- [ ] ✅ Valid Firebase email + password signs in and redirects to `/admin/dashboard`
- [ ] ✅ Wrong password shows error message in the form
- [ ] ✅ Empty email or password shows inline field errors (not a crash)
- [ ] ✅ "Forgot password" link sends a reset email (check Firebase Auth email logs)
- [ ] ✅ Signing out returns to `/admin/login`
- [ ] ⚠️ Direct navigation to `/admin/profiles` while signed out redirects to login

### Student PIN session

- [ ] ✅ Student select screen lists active profiles from Firestore
- [ ] ✅ Selecting a profile navigates to PIN entry
- [ ] ✅ Correct PIN authenticates and navigates to `/student/home`
- [ ] ✅ Wrong PIN shows error; does not navigate
- [ ] ✅ Back from PIN clears selection and returns to select screen
- [ ] ⚠️ Profile with no PIN set — verify PIN entry screen handles this gracefully
      (currently `pinHash` is nullable; behaviour on null hash not yet defined)

---

## Phase 1 (Repositories) — Firestore Implementations

- [ ] ✅ `FirestoreProfileRepository.create` returns a non-empty document ID
- [ ] ✅ `FirestoreProfileRepository.watchAll` emits updated list within ~1 s
      when a document is added or changed in Firestore console
- [ ] ✅ `FirestoreDisciplineRepository.watchAll` emits all disciplines
      (active and inactive)
- [ ] ✅ `FirestoreDisciplineRepository.watchActive` emits only active disciplines
- [ ] ✅ `FirestoreRankRepository.watchForDiscipline` emits ranks in
      `displayOrder` ascending order
- [ ] ✅ `FirestoreRankRepository.reorder` batch-writes correct `displayOrder`
      values (0-based index matching the supplied orderedRankIds list)

---

## Profile Use Cases

- [ ] ✅ `CreateProfileUseCase` throws `ArgumentError` if:
      - `firstName` is blank
      - `lastName` is blank
      - `profileTypes` is empty
      - `dataProcessingConsent` is false
- [ ] ✅ On success, returned ID matches the Firestore document
- [ ] ✅ `dataProcessingConsentDate` is stamped to `DateTime.now()` when not
      already set on the incoming profile
- [ ] ✅ `UpdateProfileUseCase` throws if name fields are blank
- [ ] ✅ `DeactivateProfileUseCase` sets `isActive: false` — profile no longer
      appears in `watchAll` filtered lists ⚠️ (only if list screens filter by isActive)
- [ ] ✅ `SetPinUseCase` — happy path sets a non-empty pinHash
- [ ] ✅ `SetPinUseCase` throws if PIN is empty or profileId is empty

---

## Profile Screens (Admin)

### Profile list screen (`/admin/profiles`)

- [ ] ✅ Shows all profiles from Firestore; updates live
- [ ] ✅ Search filters by full name (case-insensitive)

- [ ] ✅ Save is blocked while consent checkbox is unchecked (inline error shown)
- [ ] ✅ Ticking the checkbox stamps the current `privacyPolicyVersion` from
      app settings as `dataProcessingConsentVersion` on the profile
- [ ] ✅ Unticking the checkbox clears the version
- [ ] ✅ Profile saves successfully once checkbox is ticked
- [ ] ✅ In edit mode with consent already given: green read-only banner shows
      with recorded policy version; no checkbox visible
- [ ] ✅ In edit mode with consent already given: banner text directs to
      erasure process (not the form) to withdraw consent
- [ ] ✅ Editing a profile no longer resets `registrationDate` or `isActive`
      (previously these were hardcoded in toProfile())

- [ ] ⚠️ Tapping "Send" calls the `sendAnnouncement` Cloud Function — will fail with a functions/not-found error until Cloud Functions are deployed (Phase 22)

- [ ] ✅ Count > 0 enables "Run Anonymisation" button with count in label

- [ ] ⚠️ Verify that after a privacy version bump, ALL active non-anonymised profiles have `requiresReConsent: true` (check a sample in Firestore console)

## Session F — Grading Quality Improvements

### Inactive discipline guard (`CreateGradingEventUseCase`)

- [ ] ✅ Creating a grading event for an active discipline succeeds as normal
- [ ] ⚠️ If a programmatic call passes an inactive disciplineId, use case throws `ArgumentError` with the discipline name — currently no UI path triggers this since `create_grading_event_screen.dart` already filters to active disciplines

### Minimum attendance warning (`NominateStudentsScreen`)

- [ ] ✅ Nominating students with no `minAttendanceForGrading` set on their next rank proceeds without any dialog
- [ ] ✅ Nominating a student whose attendance count is ≥ the minimum proceeds silently
- [ ] ✅ Nominating a student whose attendance count is below the minimum shows the warning dialog
- [ ] ✅ Warning dialog lists student name, actual count, required count, and target rank name
- [ ] ✅ Multiple students below threshold: all listed in a single dialog (not one dialog per student)
- [ ] ✅ "Cancel" in warning dialog aborts the nomination — no records written
- [ ] ✅ "Nominate Anyway" in warning dialog proceeds and writes all nominations
- [ ] ✅ Students already at the top rank (no next rank) — no attendance check, nominated silently
- [ ] ⚠️ Attendance count fetches run serially per student — may be slow for large selections
- [ ] ⚠️ If rank data hasn't loaded yet when admin taps Nominate, check is skipped (fail open)

## Bug Fix — Setup Wizard Blank Content Area

### Symptom
PageView with NeverScrollableScrollPhysics rendered a blank white area under the step-indicator header on Android.

### Fix
Replaced PageView + PageController with IndexedStack.

- [ ] ✅ Open the app on a fresh Firebase project (no setup doc) — wizard opens to Welcome page, content visible (navy icon box, welcome text, three info tiles)
- [ ] ✅ "Continue" button visible and tappable in nav bar
- [ ] ✅ Tapping Continue advances to Owner Account page (step 2 dot highlights)
- [ ] ✅ Navigating Back from page 2 returns to Welcome — form fields on page 2 retain their values (IndexedStack preserves state)
- [ ] ✅ Complete all 4 pages with valid data — "Finish Setup" creates Firebase Auth user, writes Firestore docs, redirects to login
- [ ] ✅ After setup is complete, revisiting /admin/setup redirects to login (setup guard active)
- [ ] ⚠️ On a device where the previous PageView was blank, confirm the same device now renders correctly
